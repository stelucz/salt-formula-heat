Usage
=====

Heat is the main project in the OpenStack Orchestration program. It implements
an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based
on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. A native
Heat template format is evolving, but Heat also endeavours to provide
compatibility with the AWS CloudFormation template format, so that many
existing CloudFormation templates can be launched on OpenStack. Heat provides
both an OpenStack-native ReST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API.

Sample Pillars
==============

Single Heat services on the controller node:

.. code-block:: yaml

    heat:
      server:
        enabled: true
        version: icehouse
        region: RegionOne
        bind:
          metadata:

    heat:
      client:
        enabled: true
        template:
          admin:
            domain: default
            source:
              engine: git
              address: git@repo.domain.com/admin-templates.git
              revision: master
          default:
            domain: default
            source:
              engine: git

              revision: master

Ceilometer notification:

      server:
        enabled: true
        version: icehouse
        notification: true

.. code-block:: yaml

    heat:
      server:
        ....
        policy:
          deny_stack_user: 'not role:heat_stack_user'
          'cloudformation:ValidateTemplate': 'rule:deny_stack_user'
          # Add key without value to remove line from policy.json
          'cloudformation:DescribeStackResource':

          members:
            - host: 10.0.16.1
            - host: 10.0.16.2
            - host: 10.0.16.3
          user: openstack
          password: pwd
          virtual_host: '/openstack'
        ....

Configuring TLS communications
-------------------------------

.. note:: By default, system-wide installed CA certs are used, so the
          ``cacert_file`` param is optional, as well as ``cacert``.

- **RabbitMQ TLS**

  .. code-block:: yaml

   heat:
    server:
        message_queue:
          port: 5671
          ssl:
            enabled: True
            (optional) cacert: cert body if the cacert_file does not exists
            (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/rabbitmq-ca.pem
            (optional) version: TLSv1_2

- **MySQL TLS**

  .. code-block:: yaml

   heat:
     server:
        database:
          ssl:
            enabled: True
            (optional) cacert: cert body if the cacert_file does not exists
            (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/mysql-ca.pem

- **Openstack HTTPS API**

  .. code-block:: yaml

   heat:
    server:
        identity:
           protocol: https
           (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/proxy.pem
        clients:
           keystone:
             protocol: https
             (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/proxy.pem

Enhanced logging with logging.conf
----------------------------------

By default logging.conf is disabled.

That is possible to enable per-binary logging.conf with new variables:

* ``openstack_log_appender``
   Set to true to enable ``log_config_append`` for all OpenStack services

* ``openstack_fluentd_handler_enabled``
   Set to true to enable ``FluentHandler`` for all Openstack services

* ``openstack_ossyslog_handler_enabled``
   Set to true to enable ``OSSysLogHandler`` for all Openstack services

Only `WatchedFileHandler``, ``OSSysLogHandler``, and ``FluentHandler`` are
available.

Also, it is possible to configure this with pillar:

.. code-block:: yaml

  heat:
    server:
      logging:
        log_appender: true
        log_handlers:
          watchedfile:
            enabled: true
          fluentd:
            enabled: true
          ossyslog:
            enabled: true

Enable x509 and ssl communication between Heat and Galera cluster.
---------------------
By default communication between Heat and Galera is unsecure.

heat:
  server:
    database:
      x509:
        enabled: True

You able to set custom certificates in pillar:

heat:
  server:
    database:
      x509:
        cacert: (certificate content)
        cert: (certificate content)
        key: (certificate content)

Upgrades
========

Each openstack formula provide set of phases (logical bloks) that will help to
build flexible upgrade orchestration logic for particular components. The list
of phases and theirs descriptions are listed in table below:

+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| State                         | Description                                          |
+===============================+======================================================+
| <app>.upgrade.service_running | Ensure that all services for particular application  |
|                               | are enabled for autostart and running                |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.service_stopped | Ensure that all services for particular application  |
|                               | disabled for autostart and dead                      |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.pkgs_latest     | Ensure that packages used by particular application  |
|                               | are installed to latest available version.           |
|                               | This will not upgrade data plane packages like qemu  |
|                               | and openvswitch as usually minimal required version  |
|                               | in openstack services is really old. The data plane  |
|                               | packages should be upgraded separately by `apt-get   |
|                               | upgrade` or `apt-get dist-upgrade`                   |
|                               | Applying this state will not autostart service.      |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.render_config   | Ensure configuration is rendered actual version.     +
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.pre             | We assume this state is applied on all nodes in the  |
|                               | cloud before running upgrade.                        |
|                               | Only non destructive actions will be applied during  |
|                               | this phase. Perform service built in service check   |
|                               | like (keystone-manage doctor and nova-status upgrade)|
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade.pre     | Mostly applicable for data plane nodes. During this  |
|                               | phase resources will be gracefully removed from      |
|                               | current node if it is allowed. Services for upgraded |
|                               | application will be set to admin disabled state to   |
|                               | make sure node will not participate in resources     |
|                               | scheduling. For example on gtw nodes this will set   |
|                               | all agents to admin disable state and will move all  |
|                               | routers to other agents.                             |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade         | This state will basically upgrade application on     |
|                               | particular target. Stop services, render             |
|                               | configuration, install new packages, run offline     |
|                               | dbsync (for ctl), start services. Data plane should  |
|                               | not be affected, only OpenStack python services.     |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade.post    | Add services back to scheduling.                     |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.post            | This phase should be launched only when upgrade of   |
|                               | the cloud is completed. Cleanup temporary files,     |
|                               | perform other post upgrade tasks.                    |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.verify          | Here we will do basic health checks (API CRUD        |
|                               | operations, verify do not have dead network          |
|                               | agents/compute services)                             |
